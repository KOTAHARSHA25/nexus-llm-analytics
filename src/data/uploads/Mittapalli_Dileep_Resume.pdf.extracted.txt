PROJECTS  
Real -Time Fire Detection Using CCTV &amp; YOLOv8   
• Developed a real -time fire detection system using a YOLOv8 model integrated with OpenCV to process live 
CCTV feeds, achieving high detection accuracy across multiple camera streams.  
• Implemented email alert functionality to notify users with specific camera IDs when fire is detected, ensuring 
prompt action and safety.  
• Optimized model performance with a hybrid dataset of 20K+ fire images, enhancing detection speed and reducing 
false alarms by over 20%  
Potato Plant Disease Detection Using CNN   
• Engineered a CNN -based model incorporating 1D, 2D, and 3D convolutional layers to extract spectral and spatial 
features from leaf images.  
• Enabled early and accurate disease diagnosis to assist farmers in applying targeted fertilizers, significantly 
improving crop quality and yield.  
• Designed a user -friendly interface to ensure ease of use for non -technical agricultural users, enhancing adoption in 
rural areas.
